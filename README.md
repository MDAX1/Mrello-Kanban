# Trello-Clone website

This is my attmpt of recreating a trello clone with jQuery and bootstrap.
In this task, i build an application that works as a "kanban-board", similar to Trello.com. This is a Frontend project only and no backend has been implemented.
The idea is that i should apply what i have learned regarding jQuery, jQuery UI in JS and combine that knowledge with previous learning in JS to complete this task.
